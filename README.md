# containers-from-scratch
Writing a container in a few lines of Go code, as seen at [DockerCon 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHv6cWjvQjM&t=1316s) and on [O'Reilly Safari](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/how-to-containerize/9781491982310/)

You need root permissions for this to work. 

Also note that the Go code uses some syscall definitions that are only available when building with GOOS=linux.
